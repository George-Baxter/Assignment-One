        <h4>Lyrics</h4>
        <p>(Aye, yuh, yuh)
            Reach into my pocket, and I grab a couple crumpled hunnids<br>
            Weed look like some crumbled hunnids<br>
            Blunted out, the fuzz is hunting (woo, woo!)<br>
            Paranoia turn my stomach<br>
            H1 Hummer, rough and rugged<br>
            Desert camo trunk to the front, and shirt unbuttoned<br>
            Seat adjusted (aye)<br>
            One-hunnid miles per hour, bitch, I seem accustomed<br>
            To life in the fast lane<br>
            Nothin' in the motherfuckin' gas tank<br>
            Dumpin' ashes and laughin'<br>
            Fucking duckin' what comes from the Government (fuck)<br>
            Peelin' out into the sunset (fuck!)<br>
            Eyes so low, look like a sunset<br>

            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away (away!)<br>

            Back on my bullshit, know how to pimp it<br>
            Put my foot on the fuckin' brakes<br>
            Signed up for a life, became Yung Christ<br>
            All I got was a death wish, illness, and a piece of $uicide<br>
            Fuck this ego, fuck this pride<br>
            Easily execution on my side<br>
            Homicide, homicide, what we used to all the time<br>
            We in the Benz, off the benzos, our depression clinical (what?)<br>
            Ya' hear me?<br>
            We in the Benz, off the benzos, our depression clinical, clinical<br>
            Clinical mind (motherfucker)<br>

            $uicide...<br>
            $uicide...<br>

            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away<br>
            Grey*59, bitch, I signed my life away (away!)<br>

            We are tired of this new world<br>
            I don't want to be here<br>
            $uicide, $uicide my end<br>
            $uicide, $uicide my end<br>

            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son...<br>

            Meet me by the moon (right), half past dusk (fuck that)<br>
            Back from the dust<br>
            Cut Throat, he loves them drugs and guns<br>
            Chillin' in the cut, got about 20k and a gun (what?)<br>
            Got a pile of Adderall, cigarette butts<br>
            Every day adds up<br>
            Do I look like I give a fuck? (no!)<br>
            Every day of every month (what?)<br>
            Bloody nights turn bloodier<br>
            Death could be right in front of ya' (what?)<br>
            Still wouldn't recognize her (—hold up)<br>
            Got a death list, that some still got to catch this<br>
            Bust out the TEC, quick<br>
            Die, bitch, die, bitch<br>

            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>

            Aye, you ever had to dig your own grave?<br>
            Live your life with no name?<br>
            Backwood full of romaine, okay<br>
            '96 Benz with that cocaine paint, hoe<br>
            High until my death, I got a propane tank low<br>
            Gas seeping all over the house, until my say so<br>
            Light the fuckin' match, now that tank blow<br>
            So glad I stayed home<br>
            Someone call the cops from the payphone<br>
            Flames all around me, man, I hope they fucking drown me<br>
            Crown made of ashes, only way they fucking found me<br>
            Forget about me, only way you might not feel so lousy<br>
            Forget about me, on my own head, I would have priced a bounty<br>

            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>
            You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son<br>

            "In New Orleans, there were many bizarre things I always saw growing up here, especially in the graveyards. And as a child, I spent a lot of time in the graveyards—as an adult, I still spend a lot of time in the graveyards. But as a child, it was a regular weekend thing to do, I always needed to know why. Uhm, sometimes my whys got me in trouble..."<br>

            And for my last trick, I don't think I'm cut out for this rap shit<br>
            Aye, you wanna keep going—or?<br>
            Nah, that's it<br>
            "$uicide," I fuckin' scream it from the rooftop<br>
            The only thing I ever did worth mentioning ever since $lick burned me a CD of Lil Wayne<br>
            That shit prolly still in my boombox<br>
            But nowadays, I can walk into an establishment and select myself on the fucking jukebox<br>
            If I wanted to cop a black Countach, drive that shit like two blocks<br>
            And then smash in the back of a new cop car, now I think I'm wanted too<br>

            -Yeah, just get a bunch of face tats, it's gonna be cool<br>
            (Man, fuck you. Why you acting like such a bitch?)<br>
            SoundCloud that, SoundCloud that, SoundCloud that<br>
            -Make sure y'all [?]<br>
            -Ay man, cut that shit off, man. It suck man, garbage, man. Sounds like a fucking generic Three 6, man<br>
            -Fuck the $uicideboy$<br>
            -Shitty ass music<br>
            -Too dumb. Get the fuck outta here<br>
            -Change the station, they fucking wack<br>
            -They're way too fucking short. Get the fuck outta here<br>

            Yeah, still feel like I'm losing, aye<br>
            Me and kin still feel like we losing, aye<br>
            We still feel like we losing, aye<br>
            Losing, losing...<br>

            I'm on the lean, yeah, that drank<br>
            I'm on them bars, don't wan' think<br>
            I'm on that loud, amphetamines<br>
            Got no time for sleep, lost in my thoughts<br>
            I don't know who a friend, and who a enemy<br>
            Nerves real disturbed, down from head to toe<br>
            Ever feel like sometimes you gotta let it go?<br>
            Plenty of days, I thought this shit was over<br>
            Creator of the movement, creator of the music<br>
            Still feel like I'm losing</p>
